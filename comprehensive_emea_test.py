Comprehensive EMEA Product Positioning End-to-End Test

This script runs a complete end-to-end test of the Energy Property AI System
using a complex business query that requires multiple agents to collaborate.

Query: "What is the best product to position in EMEA, and why would we go about 
choosing this one? I need you to provide an analysis of the potential financial 
impact for this product as well as what is the projection in terms of returns or 
gains and why are we choosing this asset over other assets that are also being 
sold in that very region. Can it happen with that?"
