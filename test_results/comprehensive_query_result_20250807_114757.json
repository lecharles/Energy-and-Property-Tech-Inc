  "query": "I need to know which region is the most interesting one to focus on with regards to gross margin. Can you look at where to focus on and which are the top three selling assets that I should focus on? Make sure that in that region and for those potential accounts, those assets are not yet sold, so there's truly an upsell opportunity. After you've done that, can you come up with an explanation as to why we should focus on that region, those products, those assets, and those accounts? From there, I'm going to have to come up with a communication strategy - which marketing campaign can we aspire for and what is the best channel of communication. And why?",
