## 🧪 Testing Your System First

Before using the demo launcher, test that your system is working:

```bash
# Test the main integration system
python test_demo_execution.py
```

This will verify:
- ✅ System initialization
- ✅ Query execution capability
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Result generation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If You Don't See Real-Time Execution:**
1. **Check System Status**: Look at the sidebar for system health
2. **Wait for Initialization**: The system may still be starting up
3. **Check Terminal**: Look for any error messages
4. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed

### **Common Issues:**
- **"System not initialized"**: Wait for the system to finish starting up
- **"Import error"**: Check that all dependencies are installed
- **"Execution failed"**: Look at the terminal for detailed error messages

## 📊 Alternative Views

### **Performance Dashboard**
For system-wide monitoring:
