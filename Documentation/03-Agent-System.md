# Agent System: Energy & Property Tech Inc. Multi-Agent AI System

## ðŸ¤– Agent System Overview

The Energy & Property Tech Inc. Multi-Agent AI System employs a **specialized agent architecture** where each agent is designed to excel in a specific business domain. This approach enables the system to handle complex, multi-faceted business queries by leveraging the expertise of multiple agents working in concert.

### Core Philosophy

The system follows the principle of **"specialization over generalization"**:
- **Each agent** is an expert in one specific business domain
- **Collaborative intelligence** emerges when agents work together
- **Context sharing** allows agents to build upon each other's insights
- **Orchestrated execution** ensures optimal agent selection and sequencing

### Agent Architecture Principles

1. **Domain Specialization**: Each agent focuses on a specific business area
2. **Context Awareness**: Agents understand their role in the broader workflow
3. **Data Integration**: Agents access relevant data sources through MCP tools
4. **Structured Output**: Consistent, parseable responses for synthesis
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual agents encounter issues

## ðŸ”„ Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Execution Pattern

#### **Standard Workflow**
```
Query â†’ Operations Summary â†’ Upsell Discovery â†’ Financial Impact â†’ Campaign Planner â†’ Synthesis
```

#### **Example Query Flow**
```
User: "What's the best product to position in EMEA and what's the financial impact?"

1. Operations Summary Agent: Analyzes EMEA operational context
2. Upsell Discovery Agent: Identifies EMEA upsell opportunities
3. Financial Impact Agent: Calculates financial projections
4. Campaign Planner Agent: Creates EMEA campaign strategy
5. Synthesis Agent: Combines all insights into executive summary
```

### Parallel Execution Pattern

#### **Independent Analysis**
Some agents can work in parallel when their analyses are independent:

```
Query â†’ [Operations Summary + Upsell Discovery] â†’ [Financial Impact + Campaign Planner] â†’ Synthesis
```

#### **Context Sharing**
Agents share context through the workflow state:

```python
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    query: str
    agent_results: Dict[str, Any]
    shared_context: Dict[str, Any]
    final_response: str

# Agents can access previous results and shared context
async def upsell_discovery_agent(state: WorkflowState) -> WorkflowState:
    operations_summary = state["agent_results"]["operations_summary"]
    # Use operations summary to inform upsell analysis
    # ...
```

### Conditional Execution Pattern

#### **Dynamic Agent Selection**
The system can conditionally execute agents based on query complexity:

```python
async def select_agents(query: str) -> List[str]:
    """Dynamically select required agents based on query analysis."""
    
    required_agents = []
    
    if "operational" in query.lower():
        required_agents.append("operations_summary")
    
    if "upsell" in query.lower() or "opportunity" in query.lower():
        required_agents.append("upsell_discovery")
    
    if "financial" in query.lower() or "roi" in query.lower():
        required_agents.append("financial_impact")
    
    if "campaign" in query.lower() or "marketing" in query.lower():
        required_agents.append("campaign_planner")
    
    # Synthesis agent is always included for complex queries
    if len(required_agents) > 1:
        required_agents.append("synthesis")
    
    return required_agents
```

## ðŸ§  Agent Intelligence Architecture

### Knowledge Base Integration

#### **Domain Knowledge**
Each agent has access to specialized domain knowledge:

```python
class AgentKnowledgeBase:
    """Specialized knowledge base for each agent type."""
    
    def __init__(self, agent_type: str):
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.domain_knowledge = self.load_domain_knowledge()
        self.best_practices = self.load_best_practices()
        self.industry_insights = self.load_industry_insights()
    
    def load_domain_knowledge(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load agent-specific domain knowledge."""
        if self.agent_type == "operations_summary":
            return self.load_operations_knowledge()
        elif self.agent_type == "upsell_discovery":
            return self.load_sales_knowledge()
        # ... additional agent types
```

#### **Context Awareness**
Agents understand their role in the broader workflow:

```python
class AgentContext:
    """Context information for agent execution."""
    
    def __init__(self, workflow_state: Dict[str, Any], agent_role: str):
        self.workflow_state = workflow_state
        self.agent_role = agent_role
        self.previous_results = self.extract_previous_results()
        self.next_agents = self.identify_next_agents()
        self.expected_outputs = self.define_expected_outputs()
    
    def extract_previous_results(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract results from previous agents in the workflow."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### Learning and Adaptation

#### **Performance Feedback**
Agents receive feedback on their performance:

```python
class AgentPerformanceTracker:
    """Track and analyze agent performance."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        self.improvement_suggestions = []
    
    async def evaluate_agent_response(
        self, 
        agent_type: str, 
        query: str, 
        response: str, 
        user_feedback: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Evaluate agent response quality and provide improvement suggestions."""
        
        # Use GPT5 evaluator to assess response quality
        evaluation = await self.gpt5_evaluator.evaluate(
            agent_type=agent_type,
            query=query,
            response=response
        )
        
        # Store performance metrics
        self.performance_metrics[agent_type] = evaluation
        
        # Generate improvement suggestions
        suggestions = self.generate_improvement_suggestions(evaluation)
        
        return {
            "evaluation": evaluation,
            "suggestions": suggestions,
            "performance_trend": self.calculate_performance_trend(agent_type)
        }
```

#### **Continuous Improvement**
Agents improve based on feedback and usage patterns:

```python
class AgentImprovementEngine:
    """Engine for continuous agent improvement."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.improvement_history = []
        self.optimization_strategies = []
    
    async def optimize_agent_prompts(
        self, 
        agent_type: str, 
        performance_metrics: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Optimize agent prompts based on performance feedback."""
        
        # Analyze performance patterns
        patterns = self.analyze_performance_patterns(agent_type, performance_metrics)
        
        # Generate prompt optimizations
        optimizations = await self.generate_prompt_optimizations(patterns)
        
        # Test optimizations
        test_results = await self.test_optimizations(agent_type, optimizations)
        
        # Select best optimizations
        best_optimizations = self.select_best_optimizations(test_results)
        
        return best_optimizations
```

## ðŸ”§ Agent Configuration and Management

### Agent Configuration

#### **Individual Agent Settings**
Each agent has configurable parameters:

```python
class AgentConfig:
    """Configuration for individual agents."""
    
    def __init__(self, agent_type: str):
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.model_config = self.load_model_config()
        self.prompt_config = self.load_prompt_config()
        self.output_config = self.load_output_config()
        self.performance_config = self.load_performance_config()
    
    def load_model_config(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load model-specific configuration."""
        if self.agent_type in ["operations_summary", "upsell_discovery"]:
            return {
                "model": "gpt-4",
                "temperature": 0.3,
                "max_tokens": 2000,
                "top_p": 0.9
            }
        elif self.agent_type in ["financial_impact", "campaign_planner"]:
            return {
                "model": "gpt-4",
                "temperature": 0.2,
                "max_tokens": 2500,
                "top_p": 0.8
            }
        elif self.agent_type == "synthesis":
            return {
                "model": "gpt-4",
                "temperature": 0.1,
                "max_tokens": 3000,
                "top_p": 0.7
            }
```

#### **System-Wide Configuration**
Global configuration affects all agents:

```python
class SystemConfig:
    """System-wide configuration settings."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_concurrent_agents = 5
        self.agent_timeout = 300  # seconds
        self.retry_attempts = 3
        self.fallback_strategy = "graceful_degradation"
        self.monitoring_enabled = True
        self.logging_level = "INFO"
```

### Agent Lifecycle Management

#### **Agent Initialization**
Agents are initialized with their configuration and context:

```python
class AgentManager:
    """Manages agent lifecycle and execution."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_agents = {}
        self.agent_configs = {}
        self.performance_tracker = AgentPerformanceTracker()
    
    async def initialize_agent(self, agent_type: str) -> BaseAgent:
        """Initialize an agent with its configuration and context."""
        
        # Load agent configuration
        config = self.load_agent_config(agent_type)
        
        # Create agent instance
        agent_class = self.get_agent_class(agent_type)
        agent = agent_class(config)
        
        # Initialize agent knowledge base
        await agent.initialize_knowledge_base()
        
        # Register agent
        self.active_agents[agent_type] = agent
        
        return agent
    
    async def execute_agent(
        self, 
        agent_type: str, 
        query: str, 
        context: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute an agent with the given query and context."""
        
        # Get or create agent
        agent = self.active_agents.get(agent_type)
        if not agent:
            agent = await self.initialize_agent(agent_type)
        
        # Execute agent
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = await agent.execute(query, context)
            execution_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            # Track performance
            await self.performance_tracker.record_execution(
                agent_type, query, result, execution_time
            )
            
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle execution errors
            await self.handle_agent_error(agent_type, query, e)
            raise
```

#### **Agent Monitoring and Health Checks**

    """Monitor agent health and performance."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.health_metrics = {}
        self.alert_thresholds = {}
        self.notification_channels = []
    
    async def check_agent_health(self, agent_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check the health of a specific agent."""
        
        agent = self.active_agents.get(agent_type)
        if not agent:
            return {"status": "inactive", "reason": "Agent not found"}
        
        # Check agent responsiveness
        responsiveness = await self.test_agent_responsiveness(agent)
        
        # Check agent performance
        performance = await self.analyze_agent_performance(agent_type)
        
        # Check resource usage
