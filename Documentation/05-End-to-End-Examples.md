## ðŸ“‹ Example 1: EMEA Product Positioning Analysis

### **Query**
```
"What is the best product to position in EMEA, and why would we go about choosing this one? 
I need you to provide an analysis of the potential financial impact for this product as well 
as what is the projection in terms of returns or gains and why are we choosing this asset 
over other assets that are also being sold in that very region. Can it happen with that?"
```

  "conciseness_rating": 4,
  "completeness_rating": 2,
  "overall_assessment": "This is a succinct, directional pitch for a software analytics upsell in EMEA, but it falls short of the requested rigor. The numeric claims are internally consistent but unvalidated, and the lack of data source references significantly undermines credibility. The response partially addresses 'why this product' and gives a TAM estimate, yet it omits a concrete returns projection (ROI/payback/NPV), adoption scenarios, and a quantified comparison versus other EMEA assets.",

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting and Optimization

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **1. Slow Response Times**

**Symptoms**: Queries taking longer than expected
**Causes**: 
- High API latency
- Complex query processing
- Resource constraints

**Solutions**:
```python
# Optimize agent execution
async def optimize_agent_execution(agent_type: str, query: str):
    # Use caching for repeated queries
    cache_key = f"{agent_type}:{hash(query)}"
    if cached_result := await cache.get(cache_key):
        return cached_result
    
    # Parallel execution for independent agents
    if can_execute_parallel(agent_type):
        return await execute_parallel_agents(agent_type, query)
    
    # Standard execution
    return await execute_agent(agent_type, query)
```

#### **2. Agent Coordination Issues**

**Symptoms**: Agents not sharing context properly
**Causes**:
- Workflow state management issues
- Context passing failures
- Agent dependency conflicts

**Solutions**:
```python
# Improve context sharing
class WorkflowStateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
        self.context_history = []
    
    async def update_state(self, agent_type: str, result: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Update workflow state with agent result."""
        self.state[agent_type] = result
        self.context_history.append({
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "agent": agent_type,
            "result": result
        })
        
        # Notify dependent agents
        await self.notify_dependent_agents(agent_type, result)
```

#### **3. Data Quality Issues**

**Symptoms**: Inaccurate or incomplete responses
**Causes**:
- Missing or corrupted data
- Data format inconsistencies
- Outdated information

**Solutions**:
```python
# Data validation and quality checks
class DataQualityManager:
    async def validate_data_source(self, source_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Validate data source quality and completeness."""
        
        validation_result = {
            "source": source_name,
            "status": "unknown",
            "issues": [],
            "recommendations": []
        }
        
        # Check data completeness
        completeness = await self.check_data_completeness(source_name)
        if completeness < 0.95:
            validation_result["issues"].append(f"Data completeness: {completeness:.1%}")
            validation_result["recommendations"].append("Update data source")
        
        # Check data freshness
        freshness = await self.check_data_freshness(source_name)
        if freshness > 24:  # hours
            validation_result["issues"].append(f"Data age: {freshness} hours")
            validation_result["recommendations"].append("Refresh data source")
        
        # Determine overall status
        if validation_result["issues"]:
            validation_result["status"] = "degraded"
        else:
            validation_result["status"] = "healthy"
        
        return validation_result
```

### **Performance Optimization Strategies**

#### **1. Caching Implementation**
```python
class ResponseCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.cache_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
    
    async def get_cached_response(self, query_hash: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get cached response if available and fresh."""
        if query_hash in self.cache:
            cached_item = self.cache[query_hash]
            if time.time() - cached_item["timestamp"] < self.cache_ttl:
                return cached_item["response"]
            else:
                del self.cache[query_hash]
        return None
    
    async def cache_response(self, query_hash: str, response: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Cache a response for future use."""
        self.cache[query_hash] = {
            "response": response,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
```

#### **2. Parallel Execution**
```python
async def execute_parallel_agents(
    agent_types: List[str], 
    query: str, 
    context: Dict[str, Any]
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute multiple agents in parallel when possible."""
    
    # Group agents by dependencies
    independent_agents = []
    dependent_agents = []
    
    for agent_type in agent_types:
        if has_dependencies(agent_type, agent_types):
            dependent_agents.append(agent_type)
        else:
            independent_agents.append(agent_type)
    
    # Execute independent agents in parallel
    if independent_agents:
        independent_tasks = [
            execute_agent(agent_type, query, context)
            for agent_type in independent_agents
        ]
        independent_results = await asyncio.gather(*independent_tasks)
        
        # Update context with independent results
        for agent_type, result in zip(independent_agents, independent_results):
            context[agent_type] = result
    
    # Execute dependent agents sequentially
    dependent_results = {}
    for agent_type in dependent_agents:
        result = await execute_agent(agent_type, query, context)
        dependent_results[agent_type] = result
        context[agent_type] = result
    
    # Combine all results
    return {**dict(zip(independent_agents, independent_results)), **dependent_results}
```
