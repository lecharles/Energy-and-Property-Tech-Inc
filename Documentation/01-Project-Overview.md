# Project Overview: Energy & Property Tech Inc. Multi-Agent AI System

## üéØ What is This Project?

The Energy & Property Tech Inc. Multi-Agent AI System is a **revolutionary business intelligence platform** that leverages multiple specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive insights across operations, finance, sales, and marketing domains. Unlike traditional single-agent AI systems, this platform coordinates five specialized agents through advanced orchestration to deliver enterprise-grade business intelligence.
